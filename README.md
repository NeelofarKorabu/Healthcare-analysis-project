In this project, I focused on extracting key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the number of patients across different summaries, distinguishing between profit and non-profit organizations, and evaluating chain organizations based on their total performance score. Additionally, we analyzed data related to dialysis stations and calculated the average payment reduction rate. Our findings were presented through interactive dashboards created using Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and MySQL, facilitating informed decision-making in healthcare management.
